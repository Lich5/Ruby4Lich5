# gobject-introspection -- vendored-DLL path + typelib path + fontconfig
# setup + ABI-qualified require.
#
# Same GLib.prepend_dll_path shape as glib2's equivalent patch, plus:
# - GI_TYPELIB_PATH pointing at the vendored typelib directory (this gem
#   bundles *every* GI-stack gem's .typelib files under its own
#   vendor/local/lib/girepository-1.0/, confirmed directly against a real
#   built gem -- Atk-1.0.typelib et al. are genuinely packaged). Missing
#   until 2026-07-07: found via a real clean-machine smoke-test failure
#   (GObjectIntrospection::RepositoryError::TypelibNotFound for Atk when
#   requiring gtk3), not by inspection -- the build job sets GI_TYPELIB_PATH
#   as a *build-time-only* environment variable that never made it into the
#   shipped gem's own require-time code, so a genuinely clean machine (no
#   MSYS2, nothing pre-setting the env var) had no way to find the
#   typelibs even though they were correctly packaged all along.
# - FONTCONFIG_PATH/FONTCONFIG_FILE pointing at the vendored fontconfig
#   config, since Windows has no system fontconfig for GTK/Pango's font
#   rendering to fall back on.
#
# Deliberately does NOT port the original PowerShell's separate
# GObjectIntrospection.prepend_typelib_path(...) argument rewrite -- verified
# directly against the real 4.3.6 source that no such *call* exists anywhere
# in this gem (only the method definition does); that rewrite was already
# dead code, matching nothing, before this patch existed. GI_TYPELIB_PATH is
# a different, real mechanism: the standard environment variable libgirepository
# itself (the C library) reads to extend its typelib search path, independent
# of that dead Ruby-level method.
# Ported from patch-ruby-gnome-macos.sh (2026-07), which patches an
# already-installed gem in place; here the same anchor + exact-count
# assertion applies to freshly extracted build source instead.

# PowerShell reader for the small package-list artifact F1's Ruby CLI
# (bin/derive_dynamic_msys2_packages.rb) emits -- per docs/DECISIONS.md
# Phase 17 SS11's locked single-authority correction: this file only reads
# and transports an already-computed result. It never opens
# config/curated-gems.json, never re-derives a package list, and never
# appends the static bootstrap set itself -- Msys2Bootstrap's union with
# the registry-derived packages already happened inside the Ruby CLI
# before this artifact was written.
#
# Applies the identical strict checks Ruby4Lich5::Msys2PackageListArtifact
# (lib/ruby4lich5/msys2_package_list_artifact.rb) enforces on its own
# side of this hand-off -- unknown top-level fields, wrong schema version,
# a non-Array 'packages', an empty list, duplicate entries, unsafe package
# identifiers, a byte-order mark, or any non-UTF-8 byte sequence are all
# hard rejects here too, not just described in prose. Both readers are
# exercised against the identical shared fixture corpus (see
# spec/fixtures/msys2-package-list/).
#
# Read-Msys2PackageList is a plain function, not top-level script code --
# same shape as fetch-lich.ps1's own Invoke-LichFetch and
# verify-archive-download.ps1's own Invoke-VerifiedDownload, for the same
# reason: spec/powershell/read-msys2-package-list.Tests.ps1 dot-sources
# this file and calls the function directly against real fixture files,
# real behavioral coverage instead of only a syntax check. It throws on
# failure rather than calling exit (exit inside a function would kill the
# whole test process on the first failure path); the bottom guard converts
# that into a real exit-code/stdout contract, but only when actually run
# as a script -- $MyInvocation.InvocationName is '.' when dot-sourced, so
# the guard is a no-op during tests.

  # combined with -AsHashTable specifically, a different parameter this
  # code never uses) -- but this workflow's real target
  # (shell: powershell, Windows PowerShell 5.1) can't actually be
  # exercised from this development environment (only pwsh 7.6.3 is
  # available here), so resting a P1 correctness guarantee on cmdlet
  # documentation alone, for a real dispatch-blocking check, wasn't good
  # enough. [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[string]] and
  # [StringComparer]::Ordinal are base class library types, not a cmdlet

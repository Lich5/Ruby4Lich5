# Phase 1 Decisions

Record of the foundational decisions from `ROADMAP-woven-plan.md` Phase 1, worked out
collaboratively in 2026-07. These gate Phase 2 (front door) and beyond — see the roadmap
for how they fit into the overall build order.

## 1. Gems-server flavor: release-asset store only

No RubyGems-compatible static index (no GitHub Pages compact index). Gems are published
as GitHub Release assets on Ruby4Lich5 itself.

This was validated against a concrete future requirement: an in-game
`;lich5-update --gem=<name>` command that fetches and installs the latest matching gem
during an active Lich session. A static index would have made sense if that command
needed to speak RubyGems' own `gem install --source` protocol — but it's a bespoke Lich
command we fully control, so it doesn't need to. GitHub Releases already give a stable,
predictable download URL per tag; no compact-index infrastructure is needed.

## 2. Index schema: `gem × platform`, no ABI in the naming

Neither the release tag nor the asset filename needs to encode the Ruby ABI. Each
published gem is a **fat gem**: one package per platform, bundling precompiled binaries
for every currently-supported Ruby ABI under `lib/<gem>/<abi>/`, with a
`RUBY_VERSION`-based `require_relative` dispatch at load time — the pattern Nokogiri
already uses in production (verified directly: the installed `nokogiri-1.19.2-arm64-darwin`
gem has `lib/nokogiri/{3.2,3.3,3.4,4.0}/nokogiri.bundle`, selected by
`lib/nokogiri/extension.rb` parsing `RUBY_VERSION`).

Consequence: one release/tag per gem-version (e.g. `gtk3-v3.5.6`), with per-platform
assets (e.g. `gtk3-3.5.6-x64mingw-ucrt.gem`). The curation manifest is
`gem × platform -> {version/tag, asset, checksum}` — no ABI key.

**Build-discipline consequence:** whenever the supported-ABI set changes (adding Ruby
4.1, eventually dropping 4.0), every currently-tracked gem must be rebuilt to re-embed
*all* still-supported ABIs' binaries together, not just the new one — otherwise a user
on an older, still-supported ABI silently loses the gem the moment "latest" moves.

**Resolution mechanism** (for finding "latest," e.g. for the in-game update command):
reuse the pattern already proven in `elanthia-online/lich-5`'s own
`lib/common/update/` — try `/releases/latest` first, fall back to enumerating releases
and comparing via `Gem::Version` when there's more than one concurrent release lineage
in a repo (exactly our situation: one lineage per gem, not one for the whole repo). The
curation manifest exists specifically so this never has to enumerate/paginate the full
releases list — one fetch gets the current pin.

## 3. Repo topology: one repo, not three

Ruby4Lich5 is both the front door *and* the gems server — not a separate repo. Same-repo
means the front door's own default Actions token can publish releases with no cross-repo
write credential needed. The read side (installer-assembly, or a future in-game update)
is a public, unauthenticated fetch regardless of topology, so splitting the repos would
only have added cross-repo auth plumbing for no benefit.

Installer-assembly's long-term home is `elanthia-online/lich-5`'s own existing release
CI (see §5) — that's a *read* relationship (it consumes Ruby4Lich5's releases), not
something that changes this topology call.

## 4. Curation, pinning, and authorization

**Trigger:** manual dispatch only. No nightly builds, no auto-rebuild the moment an
upstream gem publishes — a human looks at what changed before a rebuild happens. Matches
the front door's "on demand" design from the vision doc.

**Mechanism to mirror:** `elanthia-online/lich-5`'s `prepare-stable-release.yaml`
structurally (guard → checkpoint/backup tag → open a PR for human review → separate
workflow finalizes on merge → real GitHub Release stays draft until a human publishes)
— **minus the Release Please step itself**. Release Please's job is deriving a semver
bump from *our own* Conventional Commits; gem versions aren't something we compute, they're
upstream-supplied inputs we choose to pin. The PR's diff is the curation-manifest change
itself (gem X: version A → B, asset, checksum) — arguably a more meaningful review
artifact than a generated changelog would be here.

**Installer versioning is owned by Ruby4Lich5, not by `lich-5`.** Verified directly: the
prototype's own version-resolution step and `elanthia-online/lich-5`'s live
`release-please-config.json` both currently derive the installer's version from Lich's
*own* tracked version (one Release Please package, `.`, manifest value `5.18.0`,
`extra-files` stamping that same value into `R4LGTK3.iss`). That conflates two things
that can now change independently: `lich-5`'s Release Please only ever sees `lich-5`'s
commit history, and has no visibility into a Ruby4Lich5-side gem rebuild or Ruby ABI
addition. Version identity for the installer has to be decided where the facts about its
contents actually live — Ruby4Lich5 — regardless of which org either repo sits in.

**Authorization:** must be an EO Admin (the same 5 people who hold `admin`-level access
on `elanthia-online/lich-5` via the "EO Admins" team: sandersch, ondreian, mrhoribu,
OSXLich-Doug, MahtraDR). EO Maintainers (a broader group, working mostly on scripts and
core Lich logic) are not part of this specific process. `Lich5` org's
`default_repository_permission` is currently `write`, meaning every Lich5-org member
(including two — AndreasWelch, Nisugi — who aren't EO members) has write access to
Ruby4Lich5 by default today. **Refinement needed:** a Lich5-org team mirroring EO Admins'
membership, with Ruby4Lich5's access scoped to that team (overriding the org-wide
default for this one repo) plus branch protection requiring that team's review.

**Promotion always requires the same approval chain**, no exceptions — including
promoting a beta-tested gem to production (see §7). No automation ever fires on a
signal from outside an authorized admin's direct control (see §8).

## 5. Release flow: `elanthia-online/lich-5` ↔ Ruby4Lich5

- `elanthia-online/lich-5` cuts a release (existing Release-Please pipeline). It
  publishes 4 archive artifacts: tarball + zip of the repo, tarball + zip of the app.
  A human reviews and publishes the draft release.
- **This retires an existing job.** `release-on-push-stable.yaml` currently has a live,
  shipping `build_installer` job that installs MSYS2 fresh and compiles gems at CI time
  — the "wrong call" model the vision doc says was already superseded — and it already
  attaches a working `Ruby4Lich5.exe` (confirmed: 202MB, present on the real `v5.18.0`
  release) to every stable release today. This job must be explicitly deleted as part of
  the cutover.
- A human then starts the Ruby4Lich5 workflow, which pulls the published app archive.
  Ruby4Lich5 completes its work and publishes multiple draft releases (gems, the bundle,
  the installer). A human (possibly a different person, working in unison/async) reviews
  and publishes them — installer first to complete the current cycle, gems and bundle
  releases following.
- Ruby4Lich5 then opens a **PR** (not a raw asset upload — see below) against
  `elanthia-online/lich-5` adding a small git-tracked file: version, checksum, and a
  link to the Ruby4Lich5 release asset. A human reviews and merges it.
  - **Why a PR and not a direct asset attach:** a PR operates on git-tracked files;
    attaching a binary to an existing Release is a separate mechanism entirely (a direct
    API/CLI upload, same as `release-on-push-stable.yaml` already does internally today
    for its own repo). Doing that cross-repo would require a credential able to modify
    `elanthia-online/lich-5`'s "authoritative" release with no human review in the loop
    — a materially bigger trust grant than anything else in this design, which is
    gated behind PR review or team approval everywhere else. A metadata/pointer PR keeps
    EO's review discipline intact; the tradeoff is the `.exe` itself lives only on
    Ruby4Lich5's own release, linked rather than physically attached to EO's page.
- No automated hand-off signal exists between these steps — the same small,
  overlapping group of admins coordinates in real time/async, at roughly one release a
  month, with "a quick message about who's up next" as the only hand-off. Deliberately
  not automated (see §8); acceptable given the low cadence and small, trusted group.
- End state: `elanthia-online/lich-5` remains the authoritative distribution point for
  the Lich app and bundle; Ruby4Lich5 remains authoritative for the installer and all
  gem/bundle work, linked from EO's release rather than duplicating it.

## 6. Build caching: the baked working directory

The factory's actual current build (`ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml`) installs MSYS2 only
as a transient build surface to compile native gems, then validates the result by
extracting a *fresh* RubyInstaller archive into a clean directory, stripping all
MSYS2/DevKit env vars, and running `gem install --local` of the whole bundle into it —
proving the gems load with zero MSYS2 present. Today that clean tree is built only to
smoke-test, then discarded; the actual "fetch Ruby + install the bundle" assembly
happens again later, in the installer-assembly step. Ruby4Lich5's own installer never
runs `gem install --local` on an end user's machine — Inno Setup's `[Files]` section
reads an already-assembled local directory at CI compile time and compresses it directly
into the `.exe`; the only runtime Ruby invocation is the optional, developer-only
`ridk.cmd install` for the DevKit task.

**Decision:** persist that clean-Ruby-plus-gems tree as its own release artifact instead
of discarding it — eliminating a redundant fetch-and-install cycle that currently happens
twice across two workflows. Ruby and gems are cached **together as one unit**, not
separately:

- Ruby alone is never cached — refetching a specific RubyInstaller archive is free and
  identical to grabbing the public download directly, so there's nothing to gain from a
  separate Ruby-only cache tier.
- The **assembled working directory** (a specific Ruby + all current bundle gems
  installed into it, no MSYS2) is the thing that's expensive to reproduce and worth
  retaining. It's published as its own Ruby4Lich5 release, tagged by Ruby version +
  platform, checked via a **single sha256 hash over the whole compressed archive** (not
  per-file — there's no scenario where knowing which file inside is stale helps; a
  mismatch means rebuild the whole tree).
- It is rebuilt **wholesale**, never patched incrementally, whenever *anything* in it
  changes — one gem, ten gems (e.g. a GTK3 suite bump), or the Ruby version itself all
  trigger the same "fetch fresh Ruby, `gem install --local` the current full bundle,
  publish a new working-directory artifact" cycle.
- **Fast path** (the common case — only the Lich app changed, no gem/Ruby work):
  the CI job downloads the cached working-directory archive, extracts it locally into
  the exact path Inno Setup's `[Files]` section expects, drops in the newly-fetched Lich
  app content, revalidates the single checksum, and compiles — no MSYS2, no
  RubyInstaller fetch, no `gem install --local` re-run. Doug estimates this is the
  common case, roughly 3-4 releases out of 5.
- **What gates fast-path vs. full-rebuild:** pure human judgment, for now — no automated
  drift-detection guard between the manifest's current pins and the cached artifact's
  tag. Revisit if this ever proves to be a real failure mode at scale; not solving for it
  preemptively given the low release cadence and small team.

## 7. Test vs. production installer builds

Power users / EO members need to beta-test critical gem changes (Sequel, SQLite3, GTK3,
Ox) against their *existing* Lich installation before a change is trusted enough to
promote to the production pin — motivated by a real past incident that required reactive
pin-version fixes. Production stays on the known-proven gem set until a beta-tested
change is explicitly promoted.

This doesn't need new build machinery — the existing `Ruby4Lich5-installer.iss` already
has a `"rubyonly": "Ruby Installation Only"` component type (no Lich files at all), and
the existing workflow already exposes per-gem version-override dispatch inputs
(`ruby-gnome-version`, `cairo-version`, etc.). A test-installer build is simply:

- An explicit, one-off dispatch overriding the specific gem(s) under evaluation while
  everything else defaults to the current production pin.
- **Disposable** — not part of the baked-tree caching system (§6), never persisted as a
  reusable artifact.
- **Never writes to the curation manifest.** The manifest reflects known-proven state
  only; a test build's candidate version has no manifest presence at all.
- Clearly labeled (distinct tag prefix, marked prerelease, explicit "for EO/power-user
  testing, not for distribution" in the release body) so it's never mistaken for a
  production artifact.
- Promotion to production, once a beta test passes, goes through the exact same
  admin-gated approval/PR-review chain as any other gem release (§4) — no lighter path,
  regardless of who signed off on the beta test itself (see §8).

## 8. Automation philosophy: controlled trigger, not "automated vs. manual"

The deciding factor for whether something may be automated is **whose action triggers
it**, not whether automation is involved at all. Automation firing on an event fully
within an authorized admin's direct control (their own commit, merge, or explicit
dispatch — e.g. Release Please) is fine. Automation reacting to a lower-privileged or
externally-sourced signal is not — even a purely informational one. Concretely: a
non-admin EO member marking "beta test passed" must never auto-trigger promotion; that
marker is a no-op for automation, always. It can inform a human admin's decision, but
must never be wired to fire one itself. Applies to every approval gate in this design,
not just gem promotion.

# Phase 2 Decisions

Record of the Phase 2 (front door) decisions, worked out collaboratively in 2026-07,
grounded directly in `AUDIT-ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.md` and
`AUDIT-ruby4lich5-installer.md` (both in this `docs/` folder) rather than re-derived from
scratch. Six items; see `ROADMAP-woven-plan.md` Phase 2 for how this fits the build order.

## 1. Tri-state classification

Given a gem name (+ version), classify in this order, cheapest check first:

1. **Pure?** Gemspec has zero `extensions` → pure. Fetch + package, no compile.
2. **Already precompiled upstream for our exact target platform *and* ABI?** Check for a
   published version tagged with our target platform (e.g. `x64-mingw-ucrt`) — but the
   platform tag alone is **not sufficient**. Verified directly against real rubygems.org
   data: `sqlite3` and `ffi` already ship `x64-mingw-ucrt` builds; `ox`, `curses`,
   `cairo`, `gtk3`, `glib2` do not (still only the old, pre-UCRT `mingw32` tag, if
   anything) — confirming why the factory needs to compile the GTK3 stack itself. Even
   when the platform tag matches, we must actually inspect the gem's contents for our
   specific target Ruby ABI subdirectory (the `lib/<gem>/<abi>/` convention from Phase 1
   §2) before trusting it — `required_ruby_version` is too often missing to rely on
   alone (per the gem-suite audit's §2.3 finding). If present and ABI-matching → **native,
   pass-through** (use upstream's binary directly, no MSYS2 involved).
   - **No version-hunting fallback.** If the *specific requested version* doesn't have a
     matching platform+ABI precompiled build, fall straight through to building that
     exact version ourselves. Never substitute a different (e.g. earlier) version just
     because it happens to be precompiled — that would silently ship something other
     than what was requested and reviewed. This also isn't a capability loss: the
     build-it-ourselves path is the factory's core proven capability, not a risky
     fallback, and it's specifically necessary right after adopting a new Ruby ABI, when
     upstream binaries for it don't exist anywhere yet regardless of maintainer quality.
3. **Neither of the above** — needs our own compilation. Maps to a known, maintained set
   of MSYS2 ucrt64 packages → **native-self-contained**, compile it. Doesn't map (a
   genuinely unvendorable system dependency) → **native-needs-system-lib**, reject
   loudly rather than guess.

## 2. DLL bundling strategy: consolidate to one mechanism

Per gem-suite audit §2.1/§2.2: two mechanisms exist today and only one actually works.
`extract-dll-dependencies.rb`'s dependency-aware de-duplication is dead code (its
gemspec lookup never resolves, since the build harness `chdir`s into the gem directory
first — it always returns an empty set and never deduplicates anything). The real
runtime dependency is the broad PowerShell DLL-closure walker that vendors DLLs into
`glib2`/`cairo`'s `vendor/bin`, relying on load-order + `prepend_dll_path`.

**Decision:** delete the dead per-gem Ruby script entirely; keep the PowerShell closure
walker. Fixing the dead script's gemspec-path bug would just resurrect a second
mechanism doing what the closure already does.

**Forward note, not a decision to make now:** this is PowerShell, Windows-only tooling.
When Linux/macOS are eventually built (Phase 1 §platform scope), native build (build ON
each target OS/distro, not cross-compilation) is the right approach — Linux's own
glibc/musl/arch diversity is better handled by building inside a real representative
container per target than by cross-compiling from one host, and cross-compiling to
macOS from Linux is genuinely painful and legally murky (osxcross + Apple SDK headers).
The overall classify → build → vendor-deps → smoke → publish architecture generalizes
across platforms; the vendor-deps step itself is inherently platform-native tooling
(PowerShell/DLL-closure on Windows, `ldd`/`patchelf`-shaped on Linux,
`otool`/`install_name_tool`-shaped on macOS) — three implementations, not one portable
script.

## 3. Version-literal parameterization + assert-changed patches

Per gem-suite audit §2.4/§2.5: cairo's patch step hardcodes the literal `'1.18.4'` and a
`= 4.3.\d+` regex; a version drift makes the replace silently no-op (this already cost a
real red build once, a `%q<pkg-config>` strip miss). Per the roadmap's own instruction,
this isn't a standalone patch — it's fixed by construction once gem name+version are
real per-gem inputs instead of hardcoded literals.

Two refinements beyond the audit's own recommendation:
- **Assert the exact expected match/replacement count**, not just "did anything
  change." A before/after diff would miss a regex that's slightly too loose and matches
  the wrong spot — technically non-a-no-op, but still wrong.
- **Derive the version from the actually-fetched source**, not just the dispatch input
  string. Read the real version back out of what was actually downloaded and use that
  for every subsequent patch operation, so a stale cache or wrong URL surfaces
  immediately as a mismatch rather than patching against an assumption.

## 4. Closure resolution

Reuse RubyGems' own dependency resolver (`Gem::Resolver`, or `bundle lock` against a
throwaway Gemfile requesting the target gem) rather than hand-rolling a constraint
solver — consistent with leaning on proven ecosystem tooling wherever it already solves
the problem (same reasoning as Phase 1's release-resolution mechanism).

- **Topologically sort the resolved set** (leaves first) — formalizes what the current
  prototype already does by hand for the GTK3 stack (gobject-introspection → cairo →
  cairo-gobject → pango → atk → gtk3).
- **Walk bottom-up, checking the curation manifest at each node first.** A compatible
  already-published version means skip/reuse, not rebuild. Missing or unsatisfied →
  recursively apply the same classify → build → publish pipeline to that dependency
  before touching the thing that depends on it.
- **A `native-needs-system-lib` classification anywhere in the closure fails the whole
  request loudly** — no partial-success state; you can't ship a gem whose dependency
  can't be built.
- Circular runtime dependencies aren't a practical Ruby-ecosystem concern; not building
  dedicated cycle-handling for a case that doesn't really occur.
- **Pragmatic caveat:** start with the `Gem::Resolver` path; if it doesn't hold up in
  practice, adapt without over-investing in defending the original choice.

## 5. Generalized smoke

Reuse the same resolved closure from §4: write it out as a throwaway `Gemfile` and run
`Bundler.require` against the freshly-baked tree, rather than hand-deriving a require
path per gem name (which don't always match — `tzinfo-data` requires as `tzinfo/data`,
not literally `tzinfo-data`). This also solves the audit's Part 3 "undocumented consumer
load-order contract" finding as a side effect — Bundler already requires gems in
dependency-resolved order, so there's no separate order to track.

**Scope boundary:** this item is only about making smoke gem-agnostic, not deepening
what it verifies (a truly clean runner with no MSYS2 on disk, real widget/query checks)
— that's audit §2.9, explicitly Phase 5.

**Kept exception:** `Gtk.init` stays as a post-require check specifically for GTK3, per
a real, recurring "installed / no workie" failure history that a bare `require` can't
catch. Not a precedent for hand-writing bespoke per-gem checks generally — a deliberate,
narrow exception for one gem with a documented reason, not the default.

**Bundled test-harness reconsumption (additive, informational only):** most well-
maintained gems ship their own test suite. Best-effort reuse:
- Scope detection to what's in the package **we already fetched** — a `spec/`/`test/`
  directory plus something runnable (`Rakefile` with a recognizable task, `.rspec`).
  Deliberately not also cloning the gem's upstream git repo looking for excluded tests —
  that adds a second fetch path and a "which URL/tag is authoritative" question for a
  nice-to-have.
- Attempt with what's already on hand; don't provision a bundled suite's own dev
  dependencies (test-only gems, display servers for GUI tests) to force it to run.
- **Never a hard gate.** Pass, fail, or "present but not runnable here" all just get
  written into the PR for the human to read. A failing or unattemptable bundled suite
  doesn't block build/publish — it's a data point for the approval decision, not a
  second, less-controllable smoke gate.

## 6. Publish mechanism

Reuses the same guard → checkpoint → PR-review → merge-triggers-finalize shape as
Phase 1 §4's curation mechanism, applied concretely:

1. **Guard:** if the requested gem+version already matches the manifest's current pin,
   stop — no duplicate release, no no-op PR.
2. **Checkpoint:** a timestamped backup tag of the manifest's current state before
   mutating anything.
3. **Build the full resolved closure** (§4), not just the named gem.
4. **Upload each built gem as a draft release**, one release/tag per gem-version, before
   the review step — review happens against the real built artifact and its real
   checksum, not a promise of one. (Confirmed: acceptable to spend the compute before
   approval, since a rejected draft release is just deleted.)
5. **Open one PR per dispatch, not one per gem** — a single upstream bump that touched
   ten gems (e.g. a GTK3 suite bump) is one coherent manifest diff, reviewed as one
   change.
6. **PR merge — an admin's own controlled action — triggers publishing the already-
   built draft releases**, mirroring `release-on-push-stable.yaml`'s own PR-merge-
   triggers-publish pattern. Manifest pin and the actual downloadable releases move from
   draft to live together, at the same approved moment — no window where one is current
   and the other isn't.

# Phase 5 Decisions

Record of the Phase 5 (hardening/polish) decisions, worked out collaboratively in
2026-07. Six items from the roadmap; all resolved or deliberately deferred with a
documented reason.

## 1. DevKit wizard freeze — fix, matching RubyInstaller's own reference pattern

The audit root-caused this precisely: the `[Run]` entry runs `ridk install` with
`waituntilterminated runhidden`, which blocks the Inno wizard's UI thread for the whole
of a hidden, minutes-long ~1.5GB MSYS2 download — the wizard looks hung. Of the three
options the audit offered, going with its top recommendation: move DevKit installation
to the **finish page** as a `postinstall nowait skipifsilent unchecked` task, running
`ridk.cmd install` with a visible console instead of hidden — matching RubyInstaller's
own reference `.iss` exactly (`ShellExec` with `ewNoWait` + `SW_SHOWNORMAL`).

## 2. Duplicate-installs note — documentation only, no fix needed

Audit §2.12 already verified this is expected multi-phase behavior (build → repack →
smoke produces the same gem installed 2-3 times during the pipeline), not version drift
— exactly one version of anything ever ships. Just needs a one-line log/comment note so
a future reader doesn't mistake the repeated install lines for a bug.

## 3. gio2/noise corral — curated known-good DLL list, verified against the real build

Audit §1.2's named-Win32-DLL warnings (29 lines) already have one clear recommended
rule: if it isn't in the MSYS2 ucrt64 lane, it's OS-provided, full stop. For §1.1's 711
"assuming system or non-UCRT" notices, rather than picking one of the audit's three
generic noise-reduction styles, built a real curated baseline from the actual reference
run's logs (verified directly, not estimated): **44 distinct DLL names** behind the 711
occurrences (case-insensitive; the raw extraction shows 46, but two are the same DLL
counted twice under inconsistent casing — `ws2_32.dll`/`WS2_32.dll`,
`userenv.dll`/`USERENV.dll`). All 44 are exactly the small, stable set you'd expect —
core Win32 libraries and the standard `api-ms-win-crt-*` Universal CRT api-set
forwarders — nothing gem-specific.

Mechanism: compare each "assuming system" DLL against the curated list, **case-
insensitively**. A match is silent — no log line at all. A miss (something not on the
list) gets a summary line per gem, not per DLL. This also lays the groundwork for audit
item 1.3 (fail-loud on a genuine miss), which needs exactly this kind of known-good
baseline to distinguish "known-benign" from "worth a human looking at."

## 4. `.lic`-from-master pinning — deliberately not pinned

Today's installer pulls default convenience scripts (`alias.lic`, `autostart.lic`,
`go2.lic`, etc.) from `elanthia-online/scripts`' `master` at build time, unpinned.
Decided to keep it that way, not as an oversight but because the script-update cycle is
intentionally fluid — a build is routinely "stale" within days of being cut, and that's
fine, because it's not the only mechanism keeping scripts current. Verified directly:
`scripts/scripts/repository.lic`'s `SettingsManager` tracks exactly this curated set as
`Settings['updatable'][:scripts]`, checks each one's remote timestamp on every
`;repository download-updates` run (widely believed, though not independently confirmed
by reading `autostart.lic`, to fire automatically on Lich launch), and lets a user pull
any single item out of that auto-update list via `unset-updatable` — which is exactly
the per-script pin/opt-out mechanism that makes floating safe at the installer level:
staleness at build time is smoothed over by the running application's own update cycle,
and a user who wants a script frozen already has a real, working way to do that
themselves.

## 5. Code-signing — deferred pending an upcoming policy decision

Not pursued for now; will inform next steps once decided. Nothing in this design
forecloses adding it later — signing is a post-build step against Inno Setup's single
finished `.exe`, composes cleanly with (doesn't replace) the checksum/provenance model
already in place, and the existing test-vs-production installer split (Phase 1 §7)
already gives a natural "sign production builds only" hook whenever it's adopted.

## 6. Deepen the smoke — split into environment and depth

**Environment (real fix, not yet implemented):** verified directly that this genuinely
hasn't landed yet. The archived installer-assembly workflow
(`build-ruby4lich5-installer.yaml`) already smoke-tests on an effectively clean runner,
but not because job separation was deliberately engineered for it — it never installs
MSYS2 at all, since it only consumes already-compiled gems from a Release. The actual
gem-*compilation* workflow (`ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml`, the real Phase 2 seed) is
still a single job: MSYS2 gets installed and smoke runs later in that same job, same
runner — audit §2.9's exact concern, unresolved. Fix, when Phase 2 gets implemented:
split gem-compilation and smoke into separate jobs. GitHub Actions jobs are separate VMs
by default, so this gets a genuinely clean, no-MSYS2-residue environment for free,
without containers or other infrastructure.

**Depth (no new mechanism needed):** `Gtk.init` stays as the sufficient check, per real
historical experience — it's the same check already used today to detect corrupted
installs when supporting Lich5 consumers. Going deeper (real widget creation/render) was
considered and explicitly not pursued, at least for now. For everything else, the
generalized bundled-test-suite reuse already designed in Phase 2 §5 *is* the answer to
"prove it works, not just loads" — not a second, parallel deepening mechanism.

# Phase 3 and Phase 4 — satisfied by Phase 1/2, no separate work

The roadmap's Phase 3 (gems server / index) and most of Phase 4 (installer assembly
rework) turned out to already be resolved as a side effect of Phase 1 and Phase 2, not
something requiring its own discussion:

- Phase 3's "stand up the server repo" is moot (Phase 1 §3: one repo, no separate server
  repo exists). Its "publish mechanism replacing the hand-made test prerelease" is Phase
  2 §6. Its "curation manifest + checksums" is Phase 1 §2/§4.
- Phase 4's "repoint the installer workflow at the curated set" is Phase 1 §5/§6/§7 (the
  EO↔Ruby4Lich5 release flow, baked-tree caching, test/production installer split).

The one genuinely new piece of Phase 4 — gem-suite audit §2.11, redundant default/bundled
gems — is below.

## Redundant default/bundled gems (§2.11)

Verified directly (filesystem, not the unreliable `Gem::Specification#default_gem?` —
it reported `false` even for true default gems like `date`/`psych` in this rbenv-managed
Ruby; the authoritative signal is gemspec placement in `specifications/default/` vs.
plain `specifications/`): `rexml`, `matrix`, `set`, and `webrick` are **all four bundled
gems**, not default gems — the audit's original wording singled out `set` as "the
default gem" as if it were a different category from the other three; on this Ruby
series it isn't, all four are the same classification.

**Drop `rexml`, `matrix`, `set` from the shipped bundle** — RubyInstaller already
provides all three; shipping them again is redundant. `rexml`'s presence in `lich-5`'s
own Gemfile is separately a stale leftover of a since-resolved defect pin, worth cleaning
up there directly (not a Ruby4Lich5 concern).

**Keep `webrick`**, but not for the reason initially suspected. `mechanize` does declare
`webrick (~> 1.7)` as a genuine runtime dependency (confirmed against rubygems.org), but
`mechanize` itself doesn't appear anywhere in `lich-5`, `scripts/scripts`, or
`lich_repo_mirror` — that chain doesn't apply here. The real, stronger reason:
`scripts/scripts/webui.lic` directly `require`s `webrick` and runs an actual
`WEBrick::HTTPServer` with servlets — first-party, direct, deliberate usage. Exactly the
kind of documented allowlist entry the audit's own exclusion mechanism calls for.

**`matrix` is genuinely needed, just not by us to ship.** Traced the actual dependency
chain in `lich-5`'s `Gemfile.lock`: `cairo → red-colors → matrix`, entirely inside the
GTK3/Ruby-GNOME suite. Closure resolution (Phase 2 §4) will correctly find `matrix` as a
real, declared dependency when resolving `cairo`'s closure — the bundled-gem-exclusion
filter is what correctly drops it from the *shipped* set anyway, since the base Ruby
install already satisfies it. Two different, both-correct answers to two different
questions ("is this needed" vs. "do we need to distribute it").

**`ox`** is confirmed present on both the current `runtime-gems` and `native-runtime-gems`
workflow inputs — unaffected by this cleanup, and (per earlier verification) one of the
two gems with no precompiled Windows binary upstream at any version, so it always routes
to "build it ourselves" under the classification design.

# Phase 6 Decisions

One item, additive by the roadmap's own design — no index redo needed, since Phase 1
§2's `gem × platform` matrix already accommodates a new Ruby ABI as an additional cell,
not a restructure.

**Generalize the ABI guard.** The installer-assembly workflow's `ruby-installer-version`
resolution is hardcoded to a `4.0.x` series today (audit finding, `wf 105`). Fix: make
the Ruby-series target a real per-build parameter instead of a hardcoded value, so a
future "Ruby 4.1 installer" variant is a parameter value, not a forked workflow file.
Everything else a new ABI requires — rebuilding every tracked gem to embed the new ABI's
binary, keeping the older ABI's installer variant running alongside it — is already
decided (Phase 1 §2's build-discipline consequence).

# Phase 7 Decisions

Mostly already satisfied by earlier design choices rather than new writing:

- **Consumer load-order contract** — the mechanism is already designed, not just
  documented: Phase 2 §5's `Bundler.require` reuse means gems get required in
  dependency-resolved order automatically, as a side effect of reusing Bundler rather
  than hand-rolling require order. A short written note explaining *why* (for any
  consumer not going through Bundler) is still worth adding, but the hard part — actually
  getting load order right — is already solved in the design, not left as a doc-only gap.
- **ADR** — not adopting a separate ADR-per-file convention. `DECISIONS.md` already
  serves that role, consolidated by phase rather than one file per decision; a parallel
  system would be redundant.
- **Build/release runbook** — deliberately deferred, not skipped. A runbook describing
  how to operate workflows that don't exist yet risks being wrong the moment
  implementation differs from plan. Write it once there's real code to document
  truthfully, not before.
- **Keep `GEM-FACTORY-vision.md` current** — rather than rewriting its original
  "sleep-on-it" framing (which would blur what was open *then* vs. resolved *since*), add
  a short pointer at its top to this file. Preserves the original as a historical
  snapshot while directing readers to where the current state actually lives.

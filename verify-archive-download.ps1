# Shared download-and-verify primitive, per docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 18 SS1 --
# given a URL and an expected sha256 digest, downloads to a destination path,
# hashes the local file, and either returns that verified path or throws.
# Deliberately does not resolve "which release/tag/asset" (that's two
# genuinely different policies -- exact-tag lookup vs. latest-in-series --
# left local to each caller, per Phase 18's own explicit rejection of a
# single resolver abstraction) and does not extract the downloaded archive
# (extraction/installation shape differs per caller: 7z for the .7z archive
# consumers, a silent .exe install for build-ruby4lich5-installer.yaml).
#
# Invoke-VerifiedDownload is a plain function, not top-level script code --
# same shape as fetch-lich.ps1's own Invoke-LichFetch, for the same reason:
# spec/powershell/verify-archive-download.Tests.ps1 dot-sources this file and
# calls the function directly with mocked cmdlets, real behavioral coverage
# instead of only a syntax check. It throws on failure rather than calling
# exit (exit inside a function would kill the whole test process on the first
# failure path); the bottom guard converts that into a real exit-code/stdout
# contract, but only when actually run as a script --
# $MyInvocation.InvocationName is '.' when dot-sourced, so the guard is a
# no-op during tests.

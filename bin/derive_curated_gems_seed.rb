# CLI entry point: derives config/curated-gems.json's seed content from the
# real, current staged/runtime closure -- per docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17
# section 10, not a mechanical transform of KnownNativeGems' own hardcoded
# lists. Resolves live against RubyGems.org (real network, same
# ClosureResolver/Classifier/BuildPlanner chain bin/prepare_native_gems.rb
# already uses in production), so this is real, current ground truth, not a
# guess -- but that also means its output is data entering a
# security-relevant allowlist, meant for human review before commit, not
# generated-and-trusted.
#
# Re-runnable: same root name/version pairs (recorded in this run's own
# printed summary, and in spec/fixtures/curated-gems-seed/inputs.json for
# the currently-committed seed) reliably produce the same real output when
# actually run -- real, diffable evidence of how the seed was derived, not
# a one-time trusted transcript. The assembly logic itself
# (CuratedGemsSeedBuilder) is unit-tested with fake plan data separately;
# this script is the thin, directly-run part that does real I/O, in the
# same tradition as bin/prepare_native_gems.rb.
#
# Root selection matches ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml's own real defaults --
# the FULL runtime-gems default list (15 roots: gtk3 + 14 ordinary entries),
# not just native-runtime-gems. Real gap found in review: an earlier version
# of this script only resolved native-runtime-gems (sqlite3/ox/ffi/curses),
# missing every *pure* runtime-gems default (ascii_charts, os, redis,
# sequel, terminal-table, kramdown, tzinfo, tzinfo-data, concurrent-ruby,
# webrick) -- confirmed against the real shipped
# manifest/R4L5-gem-manifest.json, whose 31 real members' non-ruby_bundled
# subset matches exactly once corrected (its own 14 *units* group some of
# these roots together, e.g. tzinfo/tzinfo-data/concurrent-ruby into one
# "tzinfo-data-runtime" unit -- a shipping-artifact grouping this registry
# doesn't need to mirror, since each is still independently a real
# requested root).
# - gtk3, at the workflow's ruby-gnome-version default (4.3.6) -- the one
#   real special-case root version source, per Phase 17 section 8.
# - Every other runtime-gems default, each resolved to its real "latest" --
#   non-prerelease, maximal by real Gem::Version comparison, never a string
#   sort. This project has no formal "resolution lock" abstraction for this
#   yet (Phase 17 section 8's own future work); the same simple, correct
#   algorithm is used directly here rather than invented differently.
#
# All 15 roots are the current default *root* selection, so all 15 get
# bundle_default: true. Every other closure member (glib2, cairo, the real
# transitive gems like rake/json/fiddle/pkg-config/rexml/redis-client/
# connection_pool/unicode-display_width/unicode-emoji/etc.) gets
# approval: approved with bundle_default: false, per section 10's two
# separate equivalence assertions.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/derive_curated_gems_seed.rb [output_json_path]
#     Defaults output_json_path to config/curated-gems.json.

# **Real fix, per review 2026-07-13: the legacy uniform MSYS2 list is not
# copied verbatim into every self-contained entry.** An earlier draft
# passed the entire current install: list -- static toolchain included --
# into CuratedGemsSeedBuilder for every native_self_contained gem, which
# both violated the already-locked static-bootstrap-outside-the-registry
# boundary (Phase 17 section 8) and meant a package removed from one
# entry would simply be reintroduced by every other entry's own copy the
# moment they're aggregated -- a "reviewed delta" that could never actually
# happen.
#
# Two real corrections applied here:
# 1. Every one of Msys2Bootstrap::PACKAGES (base-devel, make,
#    gcc/binutils/pkgconf/libffi) is excluded from the literal list below --
#    generic toolchain, never gem-specific curation, matches the
#    already-locked boundary exactly. Not a programmatic subtraction (the
#    two lists don't overlap by construction, so there's nothing to
#    subtract at runtime); Msys2Bootstrap is required here so this file's
#    exclusion is checkable against the real, canonical set rather than a
#    second hand-typed copy of it, and so a future reader can verify the
#    claim directly instead of trusting this comment alone.
# 2. mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-sqlite3 is dropped entirely, not just moved to
#    the bootstrap set -- real, traceable reasoning, not an invented
#    per-gem list: it was only ever needed to compile the sqlite3 *gem*
#    itself, which no longer happens (sqlite3 is native_pass_through
#    today). No other member of any of the 15 real resolved closures has
#    any relationship to libsqlite3.
#
# What remains (gobject-introspection[-runtime]/gtk3/pdcurses/ncurses) is
# still applied uniformly to all 12 self-contained gems today, not
# genuinely gem-specific -- **explicitly a known, transitional limitation**,
# not claimed as evidence-backed per-gem curation. Real per-gem
# decomposition (does `atk` actually need `mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gtk3`
# directly? almost certainly not) is future curation work, deliberately not
# invented here without evidence -- same principle KnownNativeGems' own
# original design note already established.

# **Real fix, per review 2026-07-13: the regeneration spec was circular for
# the package recipe.** It read msys2_packages back out of the very
# CuratedGemRegistry loaded from the committed config/curated-gems.json it
# was asserting equality against -- a uniformly-wrong recipe baked into
# every self-contained entry would regenerate itself and the spec would
# still pass, verified directly by deliberately corrupting all 12 entries
# to the same bogus value and re-running it. Fixed: this script itself
# writes the actual recipe used this run into inputs.json, generated fresh
# here rather than hand-maintained separately (the same class of drift risk
# this whole item exists to close) -- the spec now reads msys2_packages
# from this file, genuinely independent of config/curated-gems.json's own
# content, not from the registry under test.
#
# This script fully rewrites inputs.json's machine-checked fields
# (roots/platform/ruby_abi/msys2_packages) every run; the "notes" field

# F2's runtime-staging decision layer -- turns an already-resolved
# ResolutionLock (bin/resolve_bundle_lock.rb's own output) into the one
# sealed staging input (docs/DECISIONS.md's "resolve once" cutover):
# an ordered install manifest naming, for every non-ruby_bundled closure
# member, the exact verified local .gem artifact to install. The
# surrounding workflow's PowerShell then only ever executes that manifest
# literally (gem install <path> --local --ignore-dependencies, in the
# given order) -- it makes no delivery-role decisions of its own.
#
# Delivery role comes entirely from each member's own locked
# classification (see LockedArtifactMapBuilder's own doc comment):
# native_self_contained artifacts must already exist locally (this
# script never compiles or repacks anything -- that stays the surrounding
# workflow's own build/repack steps, driven by
# bin/prepare_native_gems_from_lock.rb's plan output); pure/
# native_pass_through artifacts are fetched here, verified against the
# lock's own recorded name/version/platform before ever entering the
# manifest.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/stage_runtime_gems.rb <lock_json_path> <platform> <built_gem_paths_json_path> <output_manifest_json_path>
#
# built_gem_paths_json_path: a JSON object {"name" => "/absolute/path/to/name.gem"},
# one entry per native_self_contained closure member -- the surrounding
# workflow's own responsibility to have produced (both the fixed GTK3
# build and any repacked members) before calling this.
#
# output_manifest_json_path: a JSON array of {"name", "version", "path"}
# objects, in the lock's own dependency order (leaves first) -- the exact
# sequence the surrounding workflow should run
# `gem install <path> --local --ignore-dependencies` in.
#
# Exit status:
#   0 -- success, output_manifest_json_path written.
#   1 -- a bad ARGV invocation, a real RubygemsClient network failure
#        (worth retrying), or any other unrecognized exception.
#   2 -- deterministic, do not retry: malformed lock or built-gem-paths
#        JSON (JSON::ParserError), ResolutionLock::ValidationError (a
#        malformed lock), or LockedArtifactMapBuilder::VerificationError
#        (a locally-built or downloaded artifact doesn't actually match
#        what the lock recorded). All three operate purely on inputs
#        already on disk or already resolved.

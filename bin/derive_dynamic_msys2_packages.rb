# CLI entry point for Phase 17 SS8's dynamic MSYS2 install-list derivation
# -- the actual replacement for ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml's hardcoded
# `install:` list (PR F2's job to wire in; this script and PR F1's
# diagnostic workflow prove it correct in complete isolation first).
#
# **Must run under a real, bootstrapped, target-platform Ruby -- see
# docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17 SS8's corrected bootstrap-mechanism note
# (2026-07-13).** This script never mutates `Gem.platforms` itself; it
# only asserts, before any resolution runs, that the process it is
# actually running under already reports the target platform natively.
# Simulating the target on a host Ruby via `Gem.platforms =` was found
# live to be both load-bearing (it genuinely changes candidate filtering)
# and still incomplete (`Gem::Resolver` also ranks against
# `Gem::Platform.local`, which a mutation can't override) -- the caller
# (the diagnostic workflow) is responsible for actually downloading and
# extracting the exact resolved RubyInstaller and invoking this script
# with that `ruby.exe`, not the runner's own.
#
# Two-pass order, per SS8:
#   1. Select roots (Ruby4Lich5::DefaultRootSelection) -- gtk3 keeps its
#      special-cased version; every other root resolves via
#      RubygemsClient#latest_version. cairo is never an independent root.
#   2. Resolve + classify every root's own closure (BuildPlanner), merge
#      into one flat, deduplicated closure (ClosureMerger), build a
#      ResolutionLock, gate it against the curated-gem registry
#      (RegistryPolicyGate) -- unknown or drifted members fail the run
#      closed. Derive the MSYS2 package list from every non-ruby_bundled
#      closure member's registry entry, union the static bootstrap set
#      (Msys2Bootstrap), emit a self-validated artifact
#      (Msys2PackageListArtifact).
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/derive_dynamic_msys2_packages.rb <registry_path> <registry_commit_sha> <ruby_installer_version> <output_json_path>
#
# Exit status is a real contract the surrounding workflow reads, matching
# bin/prepare_native_gems.rb's own established convention:
#   0 -- success, output_json_path written.
#   1 -- possibly transient, worth retrying: ResolutionError (wraps real
#        network failures from rubygems.org), a bad ARGV invocation, or
#        any unrecognized exception.
#   2 -- deterministic, do not retry: a platform-environment assertion
#        failure, IncompleteClosureError, UnbuildableGemError,
#        ClosureMerger::ConflictError, ResolutionLock::ValidationError,
#        RegistryPolicyGate::GateFailure, CuratedGemRegistry::ValidationError,
#        or Msys2PackageListArtifact::ValidationError. All operate purely
#        on inputs already resolved (or on a real, fixed environment
#        problem) -- retrying re-runs the exact same check and gets the
#        exact same answer.

# Gem::Platform.local.to_s is the primary check -- real gap, found in
# review: Gem.platforms alone is exactly the value the corrected
# bootstrap mechanism's own prose says a host Ruby can have manually
# mutated to include the target ("mutating Gem.platforms manually is not
# a valid substitute"), so checking only Gem.platforms made this guard
# bypassable by precisely the invalid setup it exists to forbid. A host
# Ruby with the target platform appended to Gem.platforms would pass the
# old check, then resolve/rank candidates under the wrong
# Gem::Platform.local anyway (Gem::Resolver ranks against
# Gem::Platform.local, which reflects the real running Ruby's build info
# and can't be overridden the same way -- see the corrected mechanism's
# own reasoning). Gem::Platform.local can't be mutated the way
# Gem.platforms can, so it is the one check that actually proves this is
# a real bootstrapped target Ruby, not a host Ruby dressed up as one.
#
# Gem.platforms is retained as a secondary consistency check -- it's the
# exact mechanism Gem::Resolver's own candidate filter
# (Gem::Platform.installable?) actually reads, verified directly against
# this project's real RubyGems source during review, so a real
# bootstrapped Ruby whose Gem.platforms was somehow *not* self-consistent
# with its own Gem::Platform.local would still be worth catching here.

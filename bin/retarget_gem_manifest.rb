# CLI entry point: retargets a gem recovery manifest from one bundle release
# tag to another, for the human promotion step documented in the candidate
# release's own notes (ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml's "Publish gem bundle").
#
# Retargets rather than regenerates deliberately: promotion moves the exact
# same zip bytes from the candidate tag to the live tag (gh release upload
# <live-tag> <same-local-zip> --clobber) -- the content and its SHA-256
# don't change, only which tag hosts it does. Re-running the whole generator
# against a fresh closure at promotion time would risk resolving a different
# closure than what was actually reviewed on the candidate (a real risk if
# any upstream gem published a new version in between); a plain string
# retarget of the one field that actually changes cannot do that.
#
# Only rewrites artifact.url entries that reference <old_tag> -- units whose
# artifact is an individual native gem's own release (never affected by
# bundle promotion) are left untouched.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/retarget_gem_manifest.rb <input_json_path> <old_tag> <new_tag> <output_json_path>
#
# Exit status:
#   0 -- success, output_json_path written.
#   1 -- input_json_path doesn't exist, isn't valid JSON, or contains no
#        artifact referencing old_tag at all (almost certainly the wrong
#        manifest file or the wrong old_tag argument -- fails loud rather
#        than silently writing an unmodified copy).
#   2 -- bad ARGV invocation.

# CLI entry point: builds the gem recovery manifest (docs/DECISIONS.md Phase
# 13 SS2/SS3, docs/r4l5-gem-recovery-manifest.md on lich-5) from the closure
# actually staged in the runtime bundle, and writes it as JSON. Reads
# gemspecs directly from the staged .gem files (StagedGemSpecFinder), not
# from a live Ruby's installed-gem registry -- the job this runs in has no
# such registry (it downloads only the staged files, never restores the
# build job's own installed-gem environment, which no longer exists by the
# time this runs). Deliberately runs after the individual native-gem
# releases and the bundle zip have already been published in the same job --
# both digest sources (NativeGemDigestFetcher, the bundle's own known
# digest) read already-published, already-verified values, nothing here
# re-verifies them.
#
# F2's "resolve once" cutover, extended (2026-07-13 audit finding): root
# names, ruby_abi, platform, and every closure member's own delivery state
# (native_self_contained/native_pass_through/pure) all come from the one
# already-resolved ResolutionLock (bin/resolve_bundle_lock.rb's own output),
# never from a separate hand-maintained CSV/dispatch-string pair.
# GemManifestGenerator itself never deserializes a lock (same
# injection-seam discipline as every other class here) -- this CLI is the
# one place that translation happens. ruby_bundled closure members are
# excluded before ever reaching the generator -- they're never staged, and
# have no delivery state the generator would recognize.
#
# <bundle_tag> is *this run's own* release tag (draft, live, or
# "-candidate") -- never assumed to be the live tag. Real bug, found in
# review 2026-07-10: hardcoding the live tag here meant a candidate run's
# manifest described its own dist/pkg's package list but pointed at a
# different run's (the live tag's) zip -- two different sets of bytes.
# Promoting a candidate to live is a separate, later step
# (bin/retarget_gem_manifest.rb), not something this script does.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/generate_gem_manifest.rb <lock_json_path> <repo> <bundle_tag> \
#     <bundle_filename> <bundle_sha256> <pkg_dir> <output_json_path>
#
# Exit status:
#   0 -- success, output_json_path written.
#   1 -- GemManifestGenerator::DigestValidationError (a real, deterministic
#        integrity problem -- a staged gem doesn't match RubyGems.org, or
#        RubyGems.org has nothing to check it against),
#        GemManifestGenerator::UnknownDeliveryStateError (a resolved
#        closure member's delivery state is missing/unrecognized -- a
#        lock/staging mismatch), NativeGemDigestFetcher::FetchError (a
#        native release's digest couldn't be read back),
#        InstalledGemClosure::MissingSpecError (a declared root has no
#        staged .gem file at all), or StagedGemSpecFinder::CorruptGemError
#        (a staged .gem file's own embedded metadata couldn't be read at
#        all) -- do not retry blindly; all mean something real needs
#        investigation, not a transient blip.
#   2 -- bad ARGV invocation, or ResolutionLock::ValidationError (a
#        malformed lock file).

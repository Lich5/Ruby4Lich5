# F2's final hard gate before packaging/manifest/publishing (docs/DECISIONS.md
# Phase 17 SS8 step 7, extended for the "resolve once" cutover) -- proves
# that what actually got staged/bootstrapped matches an already-resolved
# ResolutionLock (bin/resolve_bundle_lock.rb's own output) exactly. See
# StagedClosureRevalidator's own doc comment for the split-by-member-type
# rule this enforces.
#
# Takes the lock plus one real pre-stage baseline snapshot as input -- no
# separate staged-inventory or bundled-gem-inventory JSON handoff needed
# for either of those two. Both are computed by introspecting
# Gem::Specification directly, which is only meaningful because this
# script must itself run under the exact same bootstrapped target Ruby
# every other locked-input CLI in this cutover runs under (see the
# fail-fast assertion below) -- the whole point is checking *reality*, not
# re-stating whatever the install manifest already claimed.
#
# <pre_stage_baseline_json_path> is a real Gem::Specification snapshot
# (name => highest installed version) taken on this same Ruby *before* any
# lock-driven install ran -- see StagedClosureRevalidator's own doc
# comment for why this closes a real gap the lock-known-names checks alone
# cannot: an unpinned live install pulling in an undeclared transitive
# dependency wouldn't be "lock-known" at all, so only a real before/after
# comparison can catch it.
#
# **Must run under a real, bootstrapped, target-platform Ruby** -- unlike
# bin/resolve_bundle_lock.rb's own platform guard (which exists because
# RubyGems' resolver needs it), this one exists because the entire check
# is "what does Gem::Specification actually report on this Ruby" --
# running under the wrong Ruby would silently validate the wrong
# environment's own gem inventory instead of the one that matters.
#
# Usage:
#   ruby bin/revalidate_staged_bundle.rb <lock_json_path> <platform> \
#     <pre_stage_baseline_json_path>
#
# Exit status:
#   0 -- revalidation passed.
#   1 -- a bad ARGV invocation, or any unrecognized exception.
#   2 -- deterministic, do not retry: a platform-environment assertion
#        failure, ResolutionLock::ValidationError (a malformed lock), or
#        StagedClosureRevalidator::RevalidationFailure (real drift
#        between the lock and what is actually staged/bootstrapped).

  # The split revalidation from docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17 SS8 step 7 --
  # proves that what actually got staged/bootstrapped matches a
  # {ResolutionLock} exactly, closing the loop the registry gate (step 3,
  # {RegistryPolicyGate}) only opens: the gate only means something if
  # what it approved is provably what shipped.
  #
  # Deliberately never requires or accepts either of this project's two
  # live-resolution classes -- the RubyGems.org closure resolver, or its
  # underlying HTTP client -- not by convention, but structurally: this
  # file has no `require` for either, and no method here accepts one as a
  # constructor argument. "Never resolve again during staging" (SS8's own
  # locked design) is therefore impossible to violate by accident, not
  # merely discouraged. See
  # +spec/ruby4lich5/staged_closure_revalidator_spec.rb+'s own source-level
  # test proving this file's real code never references either class --
  # deliberately not named by class here either, so this comment can't
  # itself trip a future, simpler version of that same check.
  #
  # Split by member type, the real gap SS8 step 7 was corrected for: a
  # single "staged closure exactly matches the lock" rule cannot hold for
  # +:ruby_bundled+ members, since the real build already deliberately
  # excludes default gems from staged output
  # (+ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml:1086+'s own `next if spec.default_gem?`).
  # - **Non-+ruby_bundled+ members**: exact lock/staged equality -- every
  #   name+version in the lock must appear staged on disk, and vice versa.
  # - **+ruby_bundled+ members**: never compared to staged files at all.
  #   Verified instead against the bootstrapped Ruby's actual *bundled*-gem
  #   inventory -- present there, *and* that actual version satisfies every
  #   recorded `Gem::Requirement` edge naming it anywhere in the locked
  #   closure (proving presence alone isn't enough; the specific resolved
  #   constraint has to actually hold).
  #
  #   **+target_bundled_gem_versions+, not +default_gem_versions+ -- real
  #   gap, found in review.** A +ruby_bundled+ classification means
  #   {RubyBundledGems.bundled?}, which is the *union* of RubyGems' own
  #   "default" gems (auto-required, +Gem::Specification#default_gem?+
  #   true -- json, openssl, etc.) and "bundled but not default" gems
  #   (present and already compiled, but not auto-required -- rake,
  #   fiddle, matrix, rexml, and the rest of
  #   {RubyBundledGems::OTHER_BUNDLED_GEMS}). An inventory built only from
  #   +default_gem?+-flagged specifications would never contain any of the
  #   latter, so a real, correctly-classified +ruby_bundled+ closure member
  #   like +rake+ would be reported "not present" here even though it
  #   genuinely is -- a false revalidation failure, not a real drift. The
  #   caller must populate this from *every* installed specification in
  #   the bootstrapped Ruby, not just the ones flagged +default_gem?+.
  #
  # A third check, added 2026-07-13 (real gap, found in audit): every
  # violation above only ever asks "does a *lock-known* name match what's
  # staged/bootstrapped" -- neither one can notice a name that was never
  # part of the lock at all, e.g. an undeclared transitive dependency
  # pulled in by an unpinned live +gem install+ somewhere upstream of
  # staging. {#revalidate!} also compares the *complete* post-stage
  # inventory ({target_bundled_gem_versions}, every installed
  # specification) against a real pre-stage baseline the caller captured
  # before any lock-driven install ran: any name present after staging that
  # is neither in that baseline nor named anywhere in the lock's own
  # closure is unexplained drift, regardless of whether it happens to look
  # +ruby_bundled+-shaped or not.

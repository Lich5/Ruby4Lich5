  # The small, well-defined JSON hand-off artifact F1's Ruby CLI emits and
  # the PowerShell reader consumes -- per docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17 SS8:
  # schema version plus a deduplicated, deterministically-ordered array of
  # MSYS2 package-name strings (the static bootstrap set already unioned
  # in by the CLI, never appended by the reader). Self-validated on both
  # ends -- unknown top-level fields and duplicate entries are hard
  # rejects here, defense in depth matching {CuratedGemRegistry}'s own
  # discipline, even though this shape is simple enough that "duplicate
  # JSON object key" doesn't apply the way it did there.
  #
  # Encoding is a real, checked contract, not an assumption: written and
  # read as UTF-8 with no byte-order mark. PowerShell's own
  # `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` on Windows PowerShell 5.1 emits a BOM by
  # contrast -- a real, confirmed divergence from Ruby's own
  # `File.write` default -- so a BOM is treated as a hard "wrong
  # encoding" rejection on both sides, not silently stripped.

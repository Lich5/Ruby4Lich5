module Ruby4Lich5
  # Wraps the curation manifest's in-memory shape -- +gem x platform ->
  # {version:, tag:, asset:, checksum:}+, per +docs/DECISIONS.md+ Phase 1
  # SS2/SS4 -- with the one query {BuildPlanner} needs: is a given gem
  # already satisfied by what's currently pinned for a platform.
  #
  # Loading the manifest from wherever it actually lives (a Ruby4Lich5
  # release asset, once the publish mechanism from Phase 2 SS6 exists) is
  # deliberately out of scope here. This class takes already-parsed data
  # directly -- the same kind of seam {RubygemsClient} and {PatchApplier}'s
  # callers already use, so the on-disk manifest format can be decided when
  # the publish mechanism that actually writes it gets built, not guessed at
  # now.

    #   checksum:}+ (or the same shape with String keys throughout, e.g.
    #   +"gem_name" => "platform" => {"version" => ...}+). Normalized once
    #   here rather than trusted as-is: +JSON.parse+ without
    #   +symbolize_names: true+ produces String keys at every level, and
    #   this manifest is explicitly meant to become a release asset loaded
    #   from parsed JSON. Without normalizing, +entry[:version]+ would
    #   silently always be +nil+ against a real parsed manifest, reporting
    #   every already-pinned gem as unsatisfied and triggering unnecessary
    #   rebuilds -- exactly the failure mode this exists to prevent.

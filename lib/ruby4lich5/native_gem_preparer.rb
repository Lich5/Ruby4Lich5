  # The Ruby decision layer's actual entry point for one build request:
  # resolve the closure, classify each gem, and -- for every gem in the
  # fixed Ruby-GNOME/GTK3 stack ({GTK3_STACK}) -- normalize its gemspec,
  # auto-generate the common vendor-dir + ABI-require patch if it has none
  # at all yet (item 7a, {PatchGenerator}), and apply whatever curated
  # patches exist for it, hand-written or generated.
  #
  # **Not every +:native_self_contained+ gem** -- real gap, found live
  # (2026-07-13, this project's first real dispatch of the "resolve once"
  # cutover): an earlier version of this class ran the same normalize/patch
  # sequence for *every* +:native_self_contained+ closure member, on the
  # theory that it "falls out" harmlessly for a gem that doesn't need it.
  # That's true for the Ruby-GNOME family itself (every member either has a
  # curated patch, successfully auto-generates one, or hits the one
  # documented dependency-check exemption -- see {#maybe_generate_patch}),
  # but false in general: +ox+ is a real, independently self-contained gem
  # with its own C extension that doesn't use Ruby-GNOME's bare
  # +require "*.so"+ loading convention at all, so the auto-patch-
  # generator's anchor search fails with {PatchGenerator::NoAnchorFound},
  # unrescued (its one exemption is narrower, a different extensions
  # shape). Confirmed live: +ox+ has never needed this treatment -- before
  # this cutover, it was compiled and repacked entirely through the
  # surrounding workflow's own separate mechanism, never routed through
  # this class at all.
  #
  # Every {GTK3_STACK} member goes through exactly this same sequence,
  # deliberately no per-gem special-casing among *them*:
  # {GemspecNormalizer} always runs (the same transform for every one of
  # them), patch generation only ever fires for a gem with zero existing
  # patches (never touches a gem that already has any, hand-written or
  # previously generated), and {PatchApplier} always runs last and simply
  # returns an empty result for a gem that still has no
  # +patches/<gem_name>/+ directory at all after that (a real, expected
  # outcome for a gem with no compiled extension of its own). Patching
  # "falls out" for a *stack* member that doesn't need it -- it is not
  # attempted at all for a self-contained gem outside the stack.
  #
  # +:pure+ and +:native_pass_through+ gems need neither -- a pure gem has no
  # native extension to normalize, and a pass-through gem is fetched as an
  # already-published platform binary, never locally compiled at all. A
  # +:native_self_contained+ gem outside {GTK3_STACK} needs neither either,
  # but only if it is individually confirmed safe first -- on the explicit
  # {REPACK_ONLY_GEMS} allowlist (today: +ox+ and +curses+, each with its
  # own cited evidence; see that constant's own doc comment). It is then
  # compiled via ordinary +gem install+ (real
  # +extconf.rb+ machinery, no manual gemspec surgery) and repacked -- never
  # patched -- entirely by the surrounding workflow's own repack step. **Not
  # "any future addition"** -- real gap, found in review 2026-07-13, the
  # same day as the fix above: an earlier version of this comment (and of
  # {REPACK_ONLY_GEMS} itself, which briefly also listed +curses+ as
  # "believed" safe) implied every non-stack self-contained gem gets this
  # treatment. That directly contradicts the fail-closed point of the
  # allowlist -- an unconfigured gem must raise ({UnconfiguredNativeGemError}),
  # never silently repack.
  #
  # Deliberately stops at "resolve, classify, normalize, patch" -- same
  # boundary {BuildPlanner} already draws for its own scope. The actual
  # native compile (MSYS2, gcc, DLL-closure-walking) stays exactly where it
  # already is, PowerShell invoked by the surrounding workflow once this
  # returns its plan -- see docs/DECISIONS.md's "Ruby drives decisions,
  # PowerShell drives OS-level mechanics" split.

  # An immutable, serializable record of exactly what one run resolved --
  # per docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17 SS8's locked lock schema. Closes the real
  # TOCTOU that motivated it: `ClosureResolver`/`Classifier` resolve *live*
  # against RubyGems.org, so if that resolution happened once to derive an
  # MSYS2 package list and the actual build/staging happened later,
  # unrelated to this run, upstream could publish a new version in between
  # and the two could silently diverge. Persisting the resolved result as a
  # lock, then driving every later step from the lock instead of a fresh
  # resolve, closes that gap structurally.
  #
  # Deliberately a pure data holder, the same seam discipline every other
  # class here already uses (`RubygemsClient#initialize(http_get:)`,
  # `ClosureResolver#initialize(resolve:)`) -- it never shells out to Git,
  # never talks to RubygemsClient, never re-resolves anything. It receives
  # an already-resolved closure and the registry's exact identity (commit
  # SHA and content digest) as plain constructor arguments; the CLI entry
  # point that assembles a lock for a real run is responsible for actually
  # running `git rev-parse HEAD` and `CuratedGemRegistry.load_file`'s digest
  # and passing both in. Keeps this class testable without a real git
  # checkout or real file I/O in its own spec.

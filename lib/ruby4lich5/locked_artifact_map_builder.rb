  # F2's central no-re-resolution boundary (docs/DECISIONS.md's "resolve
  # once" cutover) -- turns a real {ResolutionLock}'s own closure into one
  # sealed staging input: a +Hash{name => verified local .gem path}+,
  # covering every non-+ruby_bundled+ member. Nothing downstream of
  # {#build} ever touches {RubygemsClient}/{ClosureResolver} again; runtime
  # staging only ever installs *entries already in this map*, +--local+,
  # no dependency resolution.
  #
  # Delivery role comes from the lock's own classification, never a
  # separate hand-maintained list (the hardcoded +ox+/+curses+ repack loop
  # this replaces was already evidence the old +native-runtime-gems+ input
  # wasn't authoritative):
  # - **+native_self_contained+**: compiled/repacked locally -- this class
  #   never fetches these itself. The caller (the native build step) has
  #   already produced a +.gem+ file on disk; {#build} only verifies it.
  # - **+native_pass_through+**: fetched as the exact locked upstream
  #   platform gem.
  # - **+pure+**: fetched as the exact locked +ruby+-platform gem.
  # - **+ruby_bundled+**: excluded entirely -- no artifact, ever. Verified
  #   separately, against the bootstrapped Ruby's own installed
  #   specifications (see {StagedClosureRevalidator}), not staged at all.
  #
  # Every artifact -- self-contained, pass-through, and pure alike -- is
  # verified the same way before it can ever enter the map: open the
  # +.gem+'s own embedded gemspec and confirm its name/version/platform
  # actually match what the lock recorded. The self-contained path is the
  # highest-risk one (a stale build-cache entry, a wrong version compiled)
  # but the sealed-pipe guarantee has to hold for every local +.gem+, not
  # just that one -- a corrupted or short download for a pass-through/pure
  # gem is exactly as capable of silently shipping the wrong thing.

module Ruby4Lich5
  # A +find_specs+ callable for {InstalledGemClosure} that reads gemspecs
  # directly from staged +.gem+ files on disk, rather than querying a live
  # Ruby's own installed-gem registry.
  #
  # Real gap this closes, found in review 2026-07-10: the publish job that
  # runs the gem manifest generator downloads only +dist/pkg+ (the staged
  # +.gem+ files themselves) -- it never restores the actual installed-gem
  # environment the build job assembled and then discarded when its runner
  # terminated. {InstalledGemClosure}'s default
  # +Gem::Specification.find_all_by_name+ would find nothing there (or,
  # worse, resolve to whatever happens to be incidentally installed on that
  # generic runner). Every +.gem+ file already carries its own embedded
  # gemspec (including real runtime dependencies) -- reading it directly
  # needs nothing "installed" at all, just the file on disk. Same technique
  # already established in this project for cairo's synthesized gemspec
  # (docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 8, +Gem::Package.new(path).spec+).
  class StagedGemSpecFinder
    # Raised when a staged +.gem+ file's own embedded metadata can't be
    # read at all -- a genuinely corrupt or malformed archive, not something
    # {InstalledGemClosure} could ever recover from. Names the offending
    # path explicitly (real gap, found in review 2026-07-11:
    # +Gem::Package+'s own raised errors don't reliably identify which of
    # potentially many staged files actually failed).

    #   {InstalledGemClosure} already handles by picking the highest version)

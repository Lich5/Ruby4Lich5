  # Thin, read-only facade over {CuratedGemRegistry} -- per
  # docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17 section 12's locked cutover plan. Retains
  # {KnownNativeGems}'s original method surface and exact contract ("is
  # this gem permitted to fall back to a self-build via curated MSYS2
  # packages") unchanged, so {Classifier} and every other existing caller
  # needs zero code changes -- only the data source moved, from hardcoded
  # constants in this file to the checked-in, reviewed
  # +config/curated-gems.json+.
  #
  # Deliberately narrower than "is this gem approved in the registry at
  # all" -- see {CuratedGemRegistry#self_build_packages_for}'s own doc
  # comment for the real bug this distinction closes (an approved
  # +native_pass_through+ gem, e.g. today's real `sqlite3`/`ffi`, must
  # never be mistaken for a self-build candidate).

module Ruby4Lich5
  # Groups a resolved gem closure into recovery units, per
  # docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 13 SS2/SS3 (Ruby4Lich5) and
  # docs/r4l5-gem-recovery-manifest.md (lich-5, the schema this feeds).
  #
  # A "root" is one top-level-requested name (or, for the GTK3 stack, one
  # named group of them) that gets its own named recovery unit. Every other
  # closure member is folded into whichever root(s) can actually reach it --
  # a gem transitively required by exactly one root belongs to that root's
  # unit; a gem that is *also* independently a root of its own (e.g.
  # concurrent-ruby, tzinfo -- both separately listed in the runtime-gems
  # input *and* real dependencies of tzinfo-data) appears in both places.
  # The schema has no inter-unit reference mechanism, so this duplication is
  # the accepted, deliberate way to represent "needed standalone and also
  # needed as part of this other thing" -- not a bug to dedupe away.

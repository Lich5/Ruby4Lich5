  # **Deliberately never resolves `cairo` as an independent root -- this
  # is the actual fix for the real `cairo-version`/closure mismatch gap
  # named in Phase 17 SS8, not a separate mechanism.** Checked directly:
  # only `gtk3` is ever a resolver root; `cairo` is always a *transitive
  # member* of gtk3's own resolved closure. The old, replaced design
  # independently fetched a `cairo-version` input with nothing enforcing
  # it agreed with what the gtk3 closure actually resolved. As long as
  # nothing here ever introduces a second, independent `cairo` root --
  # which this module's own return shape structurally cannot do, since it
  # only ever emits {GTK3_VERSION} plus {RUNTIME_GEMS} -- cairo's version
  # is simply whatever the real, resolved gtk3 closure contains. No
  # separate derivation step exists, or is needed, to "fix" this.

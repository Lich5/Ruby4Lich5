  # directly: +Gem::Specification.find_all_by_name+ returns empty +files+ and
  # +extensions+ for installed gems regardless of what's actually packaged;
  # only +Gem::Package.new(path).spec+ against the raw +.gem+ reflects reality.

    #   platform package. A precompiled platform package legitimately has no
    #   extensions either, since there's nothing left to build; that is not

    #   on the ucrt64 target this factory builds for -- not a Windows +.dll+)
    #   for the given ABI, under either real fat-gem convention seen in the
    #   wild: +lib/<gem_name>/<ruby_abi>/+ (e.g. sqlite3's own
    #   +lib/sqlite3/4.0/sqlite3_native.so+, confirmed directly against the
    #   real 2.9.5 package) or the flatter +lib/<ruby_abi>/+, gem-name
    #   omitted (e.g. ffi's own +lib/4.0/ffi_c.so+, confirmed directly
    #   against the real 1.17.4 package -- the gap that produced a false
    #   +:native_self_contained+ classification for a gem upstream actually
    #   already precompiles, found 2026-07-08). Checking only the nested
    #   form was an unverified assumption, not a documented convention two
    #   real, currently-classified gems don't even agree on.
    #
    #   Matching directory alone isn't enough -- a gem can legitimately ship
    #   a plain +.rb+ file under an ABI-named directory (a per-version pure-Ruby
    #   compat shim) that carries no compiled binary at all; only a +.so+
    #   there means "this ABI has a precompiled binary," confirmed real
    #   2026-07-08 by reproducing the false positive directly.

    #   the gem's upstream git repo (which might have tests excluded from

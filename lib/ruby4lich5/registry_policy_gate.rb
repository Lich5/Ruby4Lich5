  # The single, unified policy check from docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17 SS7 --
  # every non-+ruby_bundled+ member of a resolved closure must be approved
  # in the curated-gem registry for the run's exact platform/ABI, at
  # exactly the classification this run actually observed. Collapses what
  # were two separate failure modes into one check, both fail-closed:
  #
  # - **Unknown**: a shipped gem has no approved registry entry at all for
  #   this exact target (e.g. hand-typed into a selection override).
  # - **Drift**: a shipped gem has an approved entry, but this run's own
  #   live-observed {Classification} no longer matches the registry's
  #   +expected_classification+ (e.g. upstream starts shipping its own
  #   precompiled build, flipping +native_self_contained+ to
  #   +native_pass_through+).
  #
  # Generation-time only -- per SS7, this gate is never re-run at
  # promotion; that's a separate concern (Phase 15 step 3), not this
  # class's job.

  # Best-effort reuse of a gem's own bundled test suite, per
  # docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 2 SS5. Purely informational: a failing or
  # unattemptable suite is a data point reported to a human reviewer, never
  # a build gate. Attempting with what's already on hand (a Rakefile inside
  # the package we already fetched) -- not provisioning a bundled suite's
  # own dev dependencies (test-only gems, display servers for GUI tests) to
  # force it to run.

    #   valid, since it was never going to be used. Deliberately *not*

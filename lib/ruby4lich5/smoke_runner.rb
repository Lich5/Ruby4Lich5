  # Proves a resolved build plan's gems actually require successfully
  # together, per docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 2 SS5: write the plan out as a
  # throwaway Gemfile and run +Bundler.require+ against it, rather than
  # hand-deriving a require path per gem name (which don't always match --
  # +tzinfo-data+ requires as +tzinfo/data+, not literally +tzinfo-data+).
  # This also solves require *order* for free, since Bundler already
  # requires gems in dependency-resolved order.
  #
  # Deliberately gem-agnostic in scope, not deeper than that: this proves
  # requires succeed, nothing more (no real widget creation, no clean-runner
  # guarantee) -- deepening what smoke actually verifies is Phase 5's job
  # (gem-suite audit finding 2.9), not this.
  #
  # +Gtk.init+ is kept as the one narrow, justified exception: a real,
  # recurring "installed / no workie" failure history for GTK3 specifically
  # that a bare +require+ can't catch. Not a precedent for hand-writing
  # bespoke per-gem checks generally.

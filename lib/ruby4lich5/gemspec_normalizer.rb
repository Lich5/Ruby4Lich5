  # Normalizes a native gem's gemspec for the binary-gem packaging model --
  # the same transform applied identically to every native gem, unlike
  # {PatchApplier}'s gem-specific, anchor-keyed source patches. Doesn't fit
  # PatchApplier's shape at all: there's no per-gem patch file to look up,
  # because every native gem gets exactly the same four changes.
  #
  # Ported from the +Patch-Gemspec+ PowerShell function in
  # +ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml+, applied identically to all 10 native
  # gems there via a plain loop, not a per-gem patch file:
  #
  # 1. Strip +s.extensions = ...+ -- the binary gem ships a precompiled
  #    +.so+, not source to extconf against.
  # 2. Strip +pkg-config+/+native-package-installer+ runtime dependencies --
  #    build-only tooling a binary gem doesn't need at install time.
  # 3. Ensure +s.platform+ is set (only if not already present) -- marks the
  #    gem as platform-specific, required for it to be recognized as a
  #    binary gem for the target platform at all.
  # 4. Ensure the vendored +.so+/vendor files are included in +s.files+
  #    (only if not already present) -- otherwise the precompiled binaries
  #    and vendored DLLs never actually ship in the built package.
  #
  # Idempotent by construction, not by a marker check like {PatchApplier}:
  # steps 1-2 are no-ops once nothing matches; steps 3-4 explicitly check
  # for their own effect before applying it.

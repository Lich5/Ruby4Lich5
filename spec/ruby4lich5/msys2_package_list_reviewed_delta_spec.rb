# The reviewed-delta test PR F1/F2 need, per docs/DECISIONS.md Phase 17
# SS8's revised baseline-freeze note (2026-07-13): the dynamic,
# registry-derived MSYS2 package list is *expected* to legitimately differ
# from ruby4-bundled-gems-suite.yml's own hardcoded, pre-cutover list --
# sqlite3/ffi's real upstream classification moved to native_pass_through
# (PR B), so the dynamic list correctly stops requesting
# mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-sqlite3, which the legacy list still hardcodes.
# Asserting byte-identical equality against that legacy list would mean
# either forcing a stale package back in or never passing -- this asserts
# the exact, named, human-confirmed delta instead: one confirmed removal,
# zero additions. Any *other* difference (a new addition, an unexpected
# second removal) is a real signal something changed that this test's own
# human reviewer hasn't seen yet, and must fail loudly, not silently.
#
# **Selection set corrected 2026-07-13, per review**: an earlier version of
# this spec derived the "current dynamic list" from every gem name present
# anywhere in config/curated-gems.json -- global registry membership, not
# the actual set bin/derive_dynamic_msys2_packages.rb (the F1 CLI) selects.
# Those two happen to coincide today (confirmed directly: zero registry
# members are absent from the recorded default-root closure below), but
# Phase 17 explicitly permits *approved-but-dormant* registry entries --
# a gem approved for possible future use that no current default root's
# closure actually reaches. A future dormant native_self_contained entry
# would have made this spec see a package-list delta that the real CLI
# would never produce, since the CLI only ever derives packages for gems
# its own resolved closure actually contains (see the F1 CLI's own
# `closure.reject { ruby_bundled? }.flat_map { registry.self_build_packages_for(...) }`).
# Fixed: the selection set here is now the real, recorded default-root
# closure (spec/fixtures/curated-gems-seed/resolved-plan.json -- PR B's
# own committed BuildPlanner#plan_for snapshot for every default root,
# the same provenance spec/curated_gems_seed_spec.rb already trusts), not
# global registry enumeration -- no live network call either way.
